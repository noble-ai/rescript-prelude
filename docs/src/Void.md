# Void
Void is a function that given any input returns unit ()
USE SPARINGLY
Prefer a function that casts from your specific expected type to unit.
Promise and Option have examples.
The hazard here is that you can throw away an under-applied function and not get any notice!
This is a common pattern in functional languages where the function called returns some data but the caller doesnt want it.
You can see this piped in at the end of event and promise handling chains
Not too much to type out but looks awkward to write in a chain without the name.
